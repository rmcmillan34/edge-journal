- Large reports (100+ trades) may take 10-20 seconds to generate
- Screenshots embedded as base64 increase file size significantly
- No automatic cleanup of old reports (manual deletion required)

### Fixed

**Testing:**
- Added 15 comprehensive tests for saved views functionality (89 total tests passing)

### M6: Guardrails + Account Lifecycle

- Add `include_closed` query parameter to `GET /accounts` endpoint.

- Risk cap enforcement: playbook responses now check against min cap and enforce based on user's enforcement_mode.
- Loss streak enforcement: trade creation checks daily loss streaks and enforces based on enforcement_mode.
- Import guard: CSV uploads reject trades targeting closed accounts with clear error message.
- Breach logging: create breach events for loss streaks (not just risk caps).
