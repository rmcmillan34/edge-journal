## [0.7.2] - 2025-10-25

### Added - M7 Phase 2: Saved Views

**Backend:**
- New `saved_views` table to persist filter combinations with migration 0018_saved_views.
- `/views` API endpoints for full CRUD operations on saved views (list, create, get by ID/name, update, delete).
- `GET /trades` now accepts `?view=<id|name>` parameter to apply saved view filters.
- Default view support: one view per user can be marked as default and auto-applies on page load.
- User isolation with unique name constraints per user.
- View retrieval by name supports case-insensitive lookup for URL-friendly sharing.

**Frontend:**
- SaveViewModal component to save current filter configuration with name, description, and default flag.
- ViewSelector dropdown component for quick switching between saved views.
- `/settings/views` management page to list, delete, and set default views.
- Trades page integration: auto-loads default view on mount, displays "Save as View" button when filters active.
- URL addressability: share filtered views via `/trades?view=<name>` links.

**Features:**
- ‚≠ê Set one view as default (automatically loads when visiting Trades page)
- üíæ Save complex filter combinations with meaningful names for quick access
- üîó Share views via URL-friendly names (e.g., `/trades?view=EUR%20Winners`)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Manage all saved views in Settings page (rename, delete, set default)
- üîí User isolation ensures views are private to each user account

**Testing:**
- Added 15 comprehensive tests for saved views functionality (89 total tests passing)
- Full coverage of CRUD operations, user isolation, default view logic, and trades integration
- Tests verify view application by both ID and name parameters

### Fixed
- Datetime serialization in Pydantic schemas for SavedView model

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-25
### M6: Guardrails + Account Lifecycle
**Backend:**
- Add account closure tracking: `closed_at`, `close_reason`, `close_note` fields.
- Add account lifecycle API: `POST /accounts/{id}/close` and `POST /accounts/{id}/reopen`.
- Add `include_closed` query parameter to `GET /accounts` endpoint.
- Implement enforcement mode logic ('off'|'warn'|'block') for risk cap and loss streak violations.
- Risk cap enforcement: playbook responses now check against min cap and enforce based on user's enforcement_mode.
- Loss streak enforcement: trade creation checks daily loss streaks and enforces based on enforcement_mode.
- Import guard: CSV uploads reject trades targeting closed accounts with clear error message.
- Breach logging: create breach events for loss streaks (not just risk caps).
- Migration 0017: add account closure tracking fields.

**Web UI:**
- Settings: enable 'block' enforcement mode option (previously disabled).
- Settings: clarify enforcement mode labels (Off/Warn/Block).

**API Schema:**
- Add `AccountClose` and `AccountReopen` schemas for structured account lifecycle operations.
- Add `warning` field to `PlaybookResponseOut` for enforcement mode warnings.
- Extend `AccountOut` with `closed_at`, `close_reason`, `close_note` fields.

**Enforcement Module:**
- New `api/app/enforcement.py` module with `check_risk_cap_breach()` and `check_loss_streaks()` helpers.
- Supports 'off' (no enforcement), 'warn' (log + warn), 'block' (raise 403) modes.
